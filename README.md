## A lil bit more about the project:

### This fork is pretty much my personal take on Applio. ‚ú®
``You could say.. A more advanced features-rich Applio ~ With my lil twist.``
<br/>
``But If you have any ideas, want to pr or collaborate, feel free to do so!``
<br/>

<br/>
# ‚ö†Ô∏è„Ö§**IMPORTANT** „Ö§‚ö†Ô∏è
`1. Datasets must be processed properly:`
- Peak or RMS compression if necessary! ( This step isn't covered by the fork's preprocessing btw.)
- Silence-truncation ( Absolutely necessary. )
- 'simple' method chosen for preprocessing ( Even 3 sec segments. )
- Enable Loudness Normalization in the ui.
- Enable automatic LUFS range finder for Loudness Normalization. <br/>
``Expect issues with PESQ and data alignment If the following requirements are not met.``


`2. Experimental things are experimental for a reason:`
- If you don't understand what it does, what it brings or how it works? preferably don't use it.
- Certain features / currently chosen params can be potentially unstable or broken and are a subject to change.
- Not all experimental features gonna reach "stable" status ( There's only as much I can test/ablation study on my own. )
- Some experimental things might disappear at some point if deemed too unstable / not worth it.***

`3. Clarification on pretrained models, architectures & vocoders:`
- **Each Architecture/Vocoder requires own dedicated pretrains.**
##### 1. HiFi-GAN ( RVC architecture ):
- The original architecture. ( HiFi-GAN + MPD, MSD )
- It's pretrained models are auto-downloaded during the first launch.
- Available for sample rates: 48, 40 and 32khz. <br/><br/>`Models made with this arch are cross-compatible: RVC, Applio and codename-rvc-fork-4.` 
##### 2. MRF-HiFi-GAN & RefineGAN ( Fork/Applio architecture ):
- Custom architecture. ( MRF-HiFi-GAN / RefineGAN + MPD, MSD )
- **Not 100% sure on the status of pretrains yet. Once I get more info, will update this entry.** <br/><br/>`Models made with this arch are LIMITED cross-compatible: codename-rvc-fork-4 and Applio`
##### 2. RingFormer ( Fork architecture ):
- Custom architecture. ( RingFormer + MPD, MSD, MRD )
- **There are no available pretrained models for it yet.**
- Planned supported sample rates: 48khz ( and *maybe* 24khz, but that's up to dr87 ).<br/><br/>`Models made with this arch ARE NOT cross-compatible: codename-rvc-fork-4` 
<br/>

# **Fork's features:**
 
- Hold-Out type validation mechanism during training. ( L1 MEL, mrSTFT, PESQ, SI-SDR )  ` In between epochs. `
 
- BF16-AMP, TF32, FP32 Training modes available.  ` BF16 & TF32 require Ampere or newer GPUs. `<br/>
`BF16 and TF32 can be used simultaneously for extra speed gains.`
> NOTE: BF16 is used by default ( and bf16-AdamW ). If unsupported hardware detected, switched back to FP32. Inference is only in FP32.

 
- Support for 'Spin' embedder.
 
- Ability to choose an optimizer.  ` ( Supported: AdamW, AdamW_BF16, RAdam, Ranger21, DiffGrad, Prodigy ) `
 
- (EXP) Double-update strategy for Discriminator.
 
- Support for custom input-samples used during training for live-preview of model's reconstruction performance.
 
- Mel spectrogram %-based similarity metric.
 
- Support for Multi-scale, classic L1 mel and (EXP) multi-resolution stft spectral losses.
 
- Support for the following vocoders: HiFi-GAN, MRF-HiFi-gan, Refine-GAN, RingFormer.<br/>
` RingFormer architecture consists of: RingFormer ( Conformer + RingAttention, snake activations ) + MPD, MSD, MRD Discs.`
 
- Checkpointing and various speed / memory optimizations compared to og RVC.
 
- New logging mechanism for losses: Average loss per epoch logged as the standard loss, <br/>and rolling average loss over 50 steps to evaluate general trends and the model's performance over time.
 
- From-ui quick tweaks; lr for g/d, schedulers, linear warmup etc.

## Getting Started:

### 1. Installation of the Fork

Run the installation script:

- Double-click `run-install.bat`.

### 2. Running the Fork

Start Applio using:

- Double-click `run-fork.bat`.
 
This launches the Gradio interface in your default browser.

### 3. Optional: TensorBoard Monitoring
 
To monitor training or visualize data:
- Run the " run_tensorboard_in_model_folder.bat " file from logs folder and paste in there path to your model's folder </br>( containing 'eval' folder or tfevents file/s. )</br></br>If it doesn't work for you due to blocked port, open up CMD with admin rights and use this command:</br>`` netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 25565" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=25565 ``</br></br>
- Alternatively if the above method fails, run the tensorboard manually in cmd:</br> ``tensorboard --logdir="path/to/your/model/folder" --bind_all``</br>
(PS. Make sure you have tensorboard installed. ( in cmd:  pip install tensorboard )
